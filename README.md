# Eventribe
Android Application for our college and departmental events. 
This android application is being developed as a project for Android Study Jams 2021 - 2022

Problem Statement:

Our college and deparments like(CSE, IT, etc) have many clubs. These clubs conduct many events on timely basis but they dont have any platform to promote these events.
Due to this many students don't know that even these clubs exists in the college or not.

Proposed Solution :

To solve this problem we thought of creating an android application where all our college and deparmental clubs will be listed with their events so that every students will be 
aware and notified about the clubs and events which are happening in these clubs.
